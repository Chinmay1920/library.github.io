        <span style="font-size: 17px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's IT era, computers are being used everywhere. It is impossible to do daily work in the traditional way in today's era. For this, we have developed a library management system called <b>"Granthayaan"</b> to help you do the daily work of the library in a very short time with the help of computers. About it......
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>"Simplicity Softwares and Services"</b> is a company engaged in the field of computer software development, computer sales and services, as well as server administration / computer networking / infrastructure creation and IT solutions.
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public library has developed the computer system Granthayaan by considering its working methods and the problems it faces, the needs of the library staff, etc. From time to time, taking advice and guidance from library experts, various modules have been included in this computer system, considering all these aspects of how to manage it more effectively.
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Granthayaan is a computer system available in three languages, Marathi, Hindi and English. It is very easy to use and convenient and can be used by all the library staff without any errors. The main feature of this computer system is that only 5% of the total usage is done using the keyboard and all other usage is done only by clicking. This also saves your time. Along with this, the Marathi keyboard is available on the screen to type letters, making it easy to fill all the records. While filling the record, the previous information filled in by the computer is displayed in the 'in-set' and it can be selected immediately, so there is no need to type the same word repeatedly. So, as per the requirement, it can be selected by just clicking, so all the records are filled without any errors and in less time.
